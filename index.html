            <p> Hello and Welcome! I am a college student currently attending UCF in the major of Digital Media. 
                So far in my freshman year I have really honed in on my skills and opened a new direction into my 
                artistic and technical style. As much as I can recall I've always loved anything that had to do with 
                the digital media aspect of creativity and technology combining through various forms which I dabble 
                in with photoshop, film, coding, and open to so much more. I enjoy painting nature, sleeping at the 
                beach with friends, making inconsistent playlists, and collecting smiskis. Please feel free to look 
                around and enjoy some of my artwork and projects.
            </p>

        In school I participated in many Honors classes that helped me gain more knowledge and had great passing scores. I was a dual enrollment student who was able to balance work for college and high school. I worked hard in AP courses to count for Valencia College credit in pursuit of getting my Associates Degree at the same time I graduated High school.

        <br>
        I continued my full time academic career at Valencia College in Lake Nona. I planned to do the program Direct-Connect to UCF and transfer in Spring 2022 for my Bachelors degree. I took prerequisite courses for my intended major Digital Media. Held a good GPA standing and made it on the President’s Honor list for Fall 2021.
