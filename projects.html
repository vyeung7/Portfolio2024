  <h1>Works</h1>
  <p class="textbox2">
    Welcome to my latest projects I've made from previous courses. I've learned to create multiple responsive web and mobile designs using Native React, Express, Node.js, and Javascript. 
    Over thereally helped me figure out my strong suits and struggles but overall I enjoyed the process of working on each project. 
  </p>
  
  <h2>Exercise App</h2>
  <p class="textbox2" >
    The exercise app utilizes React Native with the purpose of developing an app that can track different exercises based on a repetition workout or duration workout. 
    Any duration workout will implement a timer to track how long the workout takes. 
    While any repetition workout implements a counter that will add the increments and reset. Each workout should be able to allow the user to head back to the main menu which will display all the workouts.
    The only struggles I had was trying to add the timer to pause and reset but I was able to figure out a good method to organize it so it flows properly.

  <h2>Quiz App</h2>
  <p class="textbox2">
    The Quiz app utilizes Express and React with the purpose to create a Quiz for users to practice with multiple choice, true or false, and multiple answers.
    The scoreboard after the quiz will show the right and wrong choices that will tally up the total sum of how many questiosn the user got right.
    The only struggles I have was making sure the end report to show the user the correct score of their choices.

  <h2>Menu App</h2>
  <p class="textbox2">
    The Menu app utilizes React express with the purpose of creating a menu list that will allow users to add more names to the menu and display the new name onto the list. 
    The list should be able to be filtered by names or letters to help sort out the list faster. 
    The only struggles I had was implmenting the filter by function but I was able to ensure that only letters either capital or lowercase will pass.

  <h2>Todo List</h2>
  <p class="textbox2">
    The Todo app utilizes React Native with the purpose of creating a task list that will help users keep track of any todo items that will be listed an displayed where they can be checked off once they are completed.
    Users should be able to add new tasks to the list and once an item is checked of it will be crossed out. 
    The only struggles I had was implementing the function to cross out a task once the once has checked the item off the task list, I am still figuring out the function but The overall project is well organized and functional.
